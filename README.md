# Barre3 Code Challenge

Thanks for your interest in a position at Barre3! The following is a take-home code challenge. Take as long as you need to complete it. Thoroughness is more important than turnaround time.

----
Barre3’s arch competitor, Barre4, needs your help! They have decided to create a 4 day challenge with customized workouts and meal plans for each of their four customers individually. Your task is to build a web application with a dashboard that their Master Guru can use to assign any combination of routines, warmups, and recipes to each user for each day.

## Required
* A page that shows all users, their plan for each day, and the total duration of the plan for each day.
* Functionality that enables the Master Guru to add and delete warmups, routines, and recipes for each user, for each day.
* Use Rails with ActiveRecord.

## Not Required
* CRUD operations on users, warmups, routines, or recipes.
* Any sort of design. Barre4’s owner’s ex-neighbor-in-law knows Dreamweaver and will style it once you’re done. *Do* think about usability though. Make it easy to use.
* Any sort of authentication or authorization.

To get you started, we’ve created migrations and a seeds file. Feel free to modify these as you see fit.

When you're done, zip up your whole Rails app, and email it back with step-by-step instructions for us to get it running on our dev machines.

Show us how you write production-ready code!
